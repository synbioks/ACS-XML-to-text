The parsing process has two parts: First it works on the article xml files to extract the text and meta data from them, then it looks at the supplementary files for genetic sequences. At the end, the parser outputs the extracted data as pickle files for downstream tasks. For a more detailed specification on the input/output formats, please visit the [Github repo](https://github.com/synbioks/ACS-XML-to-text/tree/acs-parser-jiawei)"

    "In general the text contains formatting tags, embedded references, and captions. Our goal is to remove these and extract the plain text. To do this, we implement `p_helper()` to retrieve the plain text in fragments, join them together into one line, and fix punctuation/parenthesis placement. We call this one line of sanitized text returned by `p_helper()` a *paragraph*. `title_helper()` is used to retrive the title in plain text. In addition to extracting paragraphs and titles, we also use the titles to label what section (intro, method, results, discussion, and so on) the paragraphs are in. The logic is coded in `extract_body()`: If we see a paragraph following a title containing \"method\", we indicate the paragraph is in \"method\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Abstract:** Abstract is found in tag `<abstract>`. It is wrapped in a `<p>` tag similar to a paragraph in the body. We use `extract_abstract()` to locate the tag and `p_helper()` to extract the plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Keywords:** Keywords can be found in tag `<kwd-group>`. `extract_keywords()` and `kwd_helper()` is used to locate and retrieve the keywords in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Publication Dates:** There are two type of dates we can find in the metadata, one is electronic publication date and the other is issue puiblication date, they are stored in `<pub-date>` tags. You can tell which is the electronic publication date by looking at the attributes of the tags. `extract_date()` handles dates extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract History of Events:** Stored in `<history>`, history of events is a list of event the article has been through. Each entry in the list contains the name of event and the date of the event. `extract_history()` handles history extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Article Type:** Located in `<subj-group>`, It indicate the type of the article, and we are currently using this to determine if an article is research article or not. `extract_article_type()` handles this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract id and internal id:** Overall, we can find three different ids that can uniquely identify an article: 1) the publication number (mentioned in \"Input Data\" section above), 2) the id in `<article-id>`, and 3) the internal id in the attribute of `<article>`. We believe 3) is an id used internally by ACS because we cannot find any public available information using this id."
