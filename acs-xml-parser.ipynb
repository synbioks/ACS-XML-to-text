The parsing process has two parts: First it works on the article xml files to extract the text and meta data from them, then it looks at the supplementary files for genetic sequences. At the end, the parser outputs the extracted data as pickle files for downstream tasks.

    "In general the text contains formatting tags, embedded references, and captions. Our goal is to remove these and extract the plain text. To do this, we implement `p_helper()` to retrieve the plain text in fragments, join them together into one line, and fix punctuation/parenthesis placement. We call this one line of sanitized text returned by `p_helper()` a *paragraph*. `title_helper()` is used to retrive the title in plain text. In addition to extracting paragraphs and titles, we also use the titles to label what section (intro, method, results, discussion, and so on) the paragraphs are in. The logic is coded in `extract_body()`: If we see a paragraph following a title containing \"method\", we indicate the paragraph is in \"method\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Abstract:** Abstract is found in tag `<abstract>`. It is wrapped in a `<p>` tag similar to a paragraph in the body. We use `extract_abstract()` to locate the tag and `p_helper()` to extract the plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Keywords:** Keywords can be found in tag `<kwd-group>`. `extract_keywords()` and `kwd_helper()` is used to locate and retrieve the keywords in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Publication Dates:** There are two type of dates we can find in the metadata, one is electronic publication date and the other is issue puiblication date, they are stored in `<pub-date>` tags. You can tell which is the electronic publication date by looking at the attributes of the tags. `extract_date()` handles dates extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract History of Events:** Stored in `<history>`, history of events is a list of event the article has been through. Each entry in the list contains the name of event and the date of the event. `extract_history()` handles history extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Article Type:** Located in `<subj-group>`, It indicate the type of the article, and we are currently using this to determine if an article is research article or not. `extract_article_type()` handles this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract id and internal id:** Overall, we can find three different ids that can uniquely identify an article: 1) the publication number (mentioned in \"Input Data\" section above), 2) the id in `<article-id>`, and 3) the internal id in the attribute of `<article>`. We believe 3) is an id used internally by ACS because we cannot find any public available information using this id."

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of WLA was tested through the design and execution of a simple protocol to transform Escherichia coli (E. coli) with the standard pUC19 plasmid. The setup of the transformation of E. coli with the pUC19 plasmid, as shown in Figure S1, was developed in WLA and executed as follows. The results are shown in Figures S2-S4. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the setup window, two resources called ecoli_source and plasmid_source were created as protocol parameters and set to E. coli competent cells Zymo 10B (Zymo Research, T3020) and pUC19 plasmid (NEB, N3041L) respectively. These resources were allocated through WLA’s use of in-line ordering. By setting these resources, a user can ensure that the protocols will use consistent source material. Two containers designated transform_plate and growth_plate were created as 96-well transparent flat-bottomed plates that conform to Transcriptic’s standards and are called 96-flat in Autoprotocol parlance. Two 6-flat agar plates called lb_agar_plate and lb_amp_agar_plate were created, and filled with 3 mL of Luria Broth (LB) agar and LB agar with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin, respectively. These reference parameters were assigned throughout the protocol to specify sources and destinations for liquid handling. Three volume parameters, ecoli_to_transform_volume, plasmid_to_transform, and transform_plate_to_growth_plate were also created with respective volumes of 50, 1, and 2 μL. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Competent E. coli cells were provisioned in 50 μL aliquots from -80◦C storage into wells A1 and A2 of the 96-flat plate called transform_plate. The pUC19 plasmid was provisioned into well A1 and mixed with the competent E. coli. This 96-flat plate was covered with a standard 96-flat lid, incubated at 4◦C with shaking for 1 minute to mix the plasmid with the competent cells, incubated at ambient room temperature without shaking for 10 minutes and then uncovered for follow-up operations. The Zymo Mix & Go Cells used do not require any heat shock. In the 96-flat plate called growth_plate, 200 μL of LB and LB with ampicillin antibiotic at 100μg/mL were dispensed into columns 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6, respectively. The transformed and untransformed cells in wells A1 and A2 of transform_plate were distributed to columns 1, 4 and 2, 5 of growth_plate respectively. Each well in Columns 1-6 were mixed after pipetting (a feature of the distribution operation) by aspirating 50 μL at 100 μL/s with 3 repetitions. Both liquid and colony growth was used to verify the transformation. Aliquots of 45 μL were spread from wells G1, G2, G3 into wells A1 and B1, A2 and B2, A3 and B3 respectively, in the 6-flat agar plate called lb_agar_plate. Aliquots of 45 μL were spread from wells H1, H2, H3 into wells A1, A2, A3 and B1, B2, B3, respectively, in the 6-flat agar plate called lb_amp_agar_plate. Absorbance measurements were taken of 96-flat plate growth_plate at 600 nm. The container growth_plate was then covered, incubated at 37◦C for 1 hour with shaking, and then uncovered in a loop carried out 18 times as shown in Figure S1. Both agar plates lb_agar_plate and lb_amp_agar_plate were imaged at time T_0, covered with a standard lid, incubated at 37◦C for 18 hours without shaking, uncovered, and then imaged again in order to capture the growth across time. All containers were then covered for storage at -20 ◦C. \n",

      "Liquid handling was done at Transcriptic via the Omni Air Displacement Pipettor (Tecan) and Bravo (Agilent) Robot. Incubation and refrigeration were done via custom Thermal Regulators (Transcriptic). Reagent dispensing was done via the Multidrop Combi (Thermo Scientific). Absorbance measurements were taken via the Infinite M200 Pro (Tecan). \n",

      "The example transformation of E. coli with the pUC19 plasmid was carried out 4 times in order to verify the reliability and repeatability of a protocol constructed on WLA both within and across runs, respectively. Run 1 was completed 2 months prior to Runs 2, 3, and 4. In all runs, wells A1-G1 of growth_plate contained transformed E. coli in LB. Wells A2-G2 contained untransformed E. coli in LB. Wells A3-G3 contained only LB and serve as a control. Wells A4-G4 contained transformed E. coli in LB and 100 μg/mL of ampicillin. Wells A5-G5 contained untransformed E. coli in LB and 100 μg/mL of ampicillin. Wells A3-G3 contained only LB and 100 μg/mL of Ampicillin and serve as a second control. In all runs, all 12 wells of both transformed and untransformed E. coli in LB-only demonstrated a lag time of less than 1 hour. In all runs, all 6 wells of transformed E. coli in LB and ampicillin demonstrated a lag time of between 4 and 5 hours. All 6 wells of untransformed E. coli in LB and ampicillin demonstrated some minor background growth. All 12 wells of LB without cells added demonstrated no growth across all runs from which it can be determined that there is no pipetting contamination across wells in the system. Figure S3A depicts the growth of E. coli averaged across wells in Run 1 (ID: r17yh8jqbjg4h) and Figure S3B depicts the growth of E. coli averaged across all 4 runs. We conclude that runs of similar composition can be said to be repeatable across time.\n",

      "Wet Lab Accelerator is a Web 2.0 application architected primarily using AngularJS with several visual components written using d3.js (https://d3js.org).  Protocols are created as Omniprotocol files and converted to Autoprotocol files in WLA before they are sent to Transcriptic for execution. Transcriptic is the first cloud laboratory system to use the Autoprotocol specification, and so WLA executes on this cloud laboratory as a default. Despite this current limitation, WLA is capable of exporting Omniprotocol to multiple formats and provides a utility library for writing schema converters. Data flows from Omniprotocol to Autoprotocol to Transcriptic, which returns experimental results to WLA for their visualization and interpretation alongside the protocol as shown in Figure S5. WLA can be easily extended to support protocols of other cloud-based labs as they become available.\n",

Note that user data files are a flat list, and will be shared across all users of a running server instance. This could be trivially extended to support multiple users by using a basic authentication mechanism. The WLA server is packaged as a Docker container. This feature makes it trivial to quickly install and run the application. \n",
